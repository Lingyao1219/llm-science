[data](https://github.com/Lingyao1219/llm-science/tree/main/data): contains three edgelists which are used for network analysis and visualization. 

[network_projection_and_metrics.ipynb](https://github.com/Lingyao1219/llm-science/blob/main/network_projection_and_metrics.ipynb): python code for bipartite projection of networks and calculation of network metrics (overall cohesion, topology, community structure, and centrality measures).

[network_visualization.R](https://github.com/Lingyao1219/llm-science/blob/main/network_visualization.R) R code for visualizing networks based on Fruchterman-reingold layout. Louvain modularity is used to cluster the networks into subgroups. Nodes and edges are filtered by the top degree centrality.
